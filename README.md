# Advent-of-Code-2023


The Goal for this year is merely to complete as many puzzles as possible using Java. I just learned Java in a CS class, hence the choice of language.
I am not focusing on readability or commenting so I apologize to any who venture beyond this point. (Might focus on that next year).
